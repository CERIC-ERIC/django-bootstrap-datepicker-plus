****************************************
Errors displayed on browser console
****************************************

Sometimes the page loads just fine, but errors are logged into browser's developer console.

.. error:: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined
.. error:: Uncaught Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery
.. error:: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
.. error:: Uncaught bootstrap-datetimepicker requires jQuery to be loaded first

The above errors are listed in the console if you forget to add jQuery to your template. Bootstrap's
JavaScript should be preceded by jQuery, otherwise Bootstrap will throw an error. Checkout our

.. error:: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Constructor' of undefined

You forgot to add bootstrap JavaScript file to your template, make sure you have both Bootstrap JavasScript
and CSS files to your included in your template. Checkout our `configuration instructions <configuration_page_>`_

Fix 404 (Not Found) errors
******************************

.. error:: GET ``http://.../datepicker-widget.js`` net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)

.. error:: GET ``http://.../datepicker-widget.css`` net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)

In some production environment you need to collect static JS/CSS resources from all packages to a single
location specified as STATIC_ROOT in ``settings.py`` file. Check your hosting provider manual to see how
to do it correctly.

Otherwise if your hosting interface provides access to console, log in to your server console and run the
following command and then reload the server from your hosting interface.

::

    python3 manage.py collectstatic

.. error:: You're using the staticfiles app without having set the STATIC_ROOT setting to a filesystem path

If you encounter above error then you don't have ``STATIC_ROOT`` directory set. Check your hosting provider
instruction manual to identify the directory it serves static files from, generally it's the ``static``
directory in your prject root. If so add the following line at the bottom of your ``settings.py`` file.

.. code-block:: python

    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")

Now you can execute ``collectstatic`` command and reload the server from your hosting interface.
